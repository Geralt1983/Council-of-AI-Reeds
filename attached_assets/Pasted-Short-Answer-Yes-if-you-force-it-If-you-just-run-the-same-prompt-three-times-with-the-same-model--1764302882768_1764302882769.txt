Short Answer: Yes, if you force it.
If you just run the same prompt three times with the same model, you will get mostly identical answers. However, you can "trick" a single LLM into having a split personality using three specific levers.
Here is how to ensure diversity without paying for three different API subscriptions:
1. The "Persona" Lever (Most Effective)
You must drastically change the System Prompt for each worker. The underlying model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) is huge; it contains many "sub-personalities."
 * Worker A (The Optimist): "You are a Silicon Valley VC. You only see potential, upside, and growth. Ignore risks."
 * Worker B (The Pessimist): "You are a risk-management auditor. You only see failure points, bugs, and edge cases. Be harsh."
 * Worker C (The Historian): "You are an academic. You only care about precedent and what has been done before."
Result: Even though it's the same brain, the output will be radically different.
2. The "Temperature" Lever (The Chaos Knob)
In the code I gave you, look at the temperature setting in the get_agent_response function.
 * Low Temp (0.1): Deterministic, boring, factual.
 * High Temp (0.8 - 1.0): Creative, random, diverse.
 * Strategy: Crank the temperature up to 0.9 for the Workers to force variety, but keep the Judge at 0.2 so it remains logical and consistent.
3. The "True Diversity" Upgrade (Harder)
If you find the answers are still too similar, the next step is using different families of models. Different training data = different biases.
 * Worker A: GPT-4o (OpenAI)
 * Worker B: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
 * Worker C: Llama 3 (Meta/Groq)
Note: This complicates your code because you need 3 different API keys and SDK setups.
Code Tweak for Diversity
In the main.py I gave you, find the get_agent_response function and change the temperature to 0.9:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=MODEL_WORKER,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.9 # Changed from 0.7 to 0.9 for higher variance
    )

Action Item
Would you like me to provide 3 distinct "Persona Prompts" tailored to a specific topic (like managing your schedule or coding) to test if the diversity is high enough?
